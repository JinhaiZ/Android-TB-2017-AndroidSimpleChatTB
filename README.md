## Simple Tchat

This project is a teaching support for an introductory course to Android
development.

The tutorial relies on the use of the [Git](http://git-scm.com/) versioning system for source code management. You don't need to know anything about Git to follow the tutorial other than how to install and run a few git commands.


### Step-0: Create project

You begin a new project, `SimpleTchat`.
